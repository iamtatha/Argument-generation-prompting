Do you think the primary advantage of a EU military is that military operations conducted under the authority of EU institutions would have a level of legitimacy that neither individual national states ( or coalitions of such states ) or the UN security council could provide? If so, can you say more about why you think that?"}

People's need for a livable age should be addressed with universal basic income. This would remove these controversies regarding appropriate level of minimum wage. Universal basic income is a government liability, which we privatize by raising the minimum wage instead. This would also have an unintended ( perhaps intended ) consequence of raising the price of everything that involves labor to manufacture and distribute. In the mean time, there is a large portion of the population who don't have jobs and thus don't see benefits of higher minimum wage, but do see the detriments of raised prices of goods."}

Now you say what's the point then, won't that just create inflation? Whats the value in paying a poor minimum wage apple picker more if you then have to go around and charge him more for the apples he buys at the grocery store? Now his savings from his wages from last week are worth relatively less since cost of all the goods and services have increased but the interest on his savings hasn't gone up. This looks like a grim scenario. But now consider the yacht buyer who is looking to buy a yacht made by minimum wage workers and when the minimum wage was raised all of a sudden the cost to build a yacht increased, inflation made his savings worth a lot less and he didn't get a raise. He might not be able to afford a yacht now in this new economy and the workers that would have made it will now be providing goods and services to this new market of minimum wage consumers."}

They need to be able to afford basic things like food, housing, education, transportation and clothes. Currently, that isn't possible with most minimum wages in the US. It's disgraceful that businesses are allowed to let workers have one or more full time jobs without paying them enough to live a very basic life. Increasing the wages will decrease the profits of the company. But who does that hurt? In most cases it's the really wealthy owners, the CEO's and others in the top 1 %. Is that really a bad thing? I'm not saying that they shouldn't be allowed to make lot of money, but do you really believe that they should be able to make that money at the cost of the people they employ? If the businesses aren't able to survive while paying living wages to their workers, maybe they shoud give the place to someone that can?"}

But see Worthy v. United States, 328 F. 2d 386, 394 ( 5th Cir. 1964 ) ( \u201cWe think it is inherent in the concept of citizenship that the citizen, when absent from the country to which he owes allegiance, has a right to return, again to set foot on its soil. \u201d ). On the other hand, some justices of the Supreme Court have contemplated the permissibility of banishment as a punishment for crime. See, e. g., Justice Brewer\u2019s dissent in Fong Yue Ting ( \u201cBanishment may be resorted to as punishment for crime\u201d ). International law seems to admit that possibility too : Art. 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights declares that \u201cno one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country, \u201d but non - arbitrary deprivations of that right are implicitly entertained. The U. S. has ratified the ICCPR so its stipulations are the law of the land, albeit non - self - executing. And I don\u2019t think Wong Kim Ark is pertinent. The Chinese Exclusion Act by its own terms excluded only aliens, not citizens, and doesn\u2019t answer the question of whether Congress may statutorily exclude citizens."}

You could have the most \" effective legislation \" ( setting aside what that is, exactly ), but if the governing bodies are not a good representation of the society they legislate, the result is always going to be worse for the people than it would've been if the representation was better. In that way, a rise in female representation is a good thing onto itself, as it makes it so that legislation has a better mandate. Whether or not that increases the effectivity of said legislation is a separate matter altogether."}
